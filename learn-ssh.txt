  2. Store the id_rsa.pub on server ~/.ssh/authorized_keys folder 
    then use the command:
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh demo@198.51.100.0 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >>  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
- Then your already setup!. You can connect to your server without password by using ssh that you generated!
