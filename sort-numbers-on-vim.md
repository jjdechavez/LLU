# How to sort number on vim

To this tutorial we are going to use some linux command called `sort`

In order to sort on vim you need to highlight the row of numbers by `V` or <shift> + v in order to highlight
Then press colon then write the command by `!sort -n` inorder to sort the numbers

In order to sort reverse/opposite on `sort` command you need to add flag `-r` which is `!sort -n -r`
