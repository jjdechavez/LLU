There's different mode mapping
(n: normal mode, v: visual mode, i: insert mode)
- nmap
- vmap
- imap

To avoid recursive mappings make sure to put "nore" after mode of map
sample - nnoremap

*real scenario*
```vim
imap l kk
inoremap l aa
imap a g
```

when you're in insert mode and type l after the imap finished the map.
it will truigger the inoremap l which have aa map then i will stop the revursive mappings.

<leader> means the leader key that you set on your vim. Which can found "let mapleader"

<CR> means character return or enter to proceed on next line.

<c-r> || <C-r> means Ctrl+r and run the map
